to know the personality of his patient as well as helping the patient with valuable advices based on his personality.

Implemented the knowledge aquired from the expert using <b>Pyke</b> (A form of Logic Programming providing a knowledge-based inference engine (expert system)). </br>
Created a GUI to represent that knowledge using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Django.
